Alternatively, you can add SocketKit as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file. For example:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.1
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "PackageName",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "PackageName",
            targets: ["YourPackage"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/MohammadRezaAnsari/ExtensionKit", from: "1.6.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "PackageName",
            dependencies: ["ExtensionKit"]),
    ]
)
